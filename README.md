# EDA-on-Spotify-2023-Dataset

## Insights
### Cleaning of Dataset
- I noticed that there are duplicated songs in the dataset, null values, and unwanted values such as the singular string in the `streams` column (Assuming it was an error in the gathering of data). 
- There is another datatype named 'object' which is basically a datatype that can store various types of data like int, string, float, etc. This is shown when there is more than 1 datatype in a column
### Answering the Guide Questions
- The distribution graph of the `released_year` column reveals a trend indicating that songs released closer to the datasetâ€™s collection year tend to have higher stream counts on Spotify. This pattern suggests that songs generally gain popularity the more recent they are.
- Furthermore, there is a noticeable decline in the number of songs included from the year 2023, the same year the data was collected. This likely reflects a threshold at which the trend ceases, presumably because songs require a certain period to accumulate streams.
